# Computer Music Programming projects

This is a project site designed during my time in CS 190 (Spring 2020) at UCI, which teaches audio programming with the JS Web Audio API and Cycling '74 Max.
This course was taught by Professor [Christopher Dobrian](https://dobrian.github.io/cmp/week-by-week.html).
